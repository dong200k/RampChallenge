This file notes down some weird things I discovered.

New Bug 1:
    Howto reproduce bug (be sure to refresh the page): 
    1. First select an employee from the dropdown
    2. Then after the filter loads, select another employee

    Expected Behavior: After each selection the transactions should be loading.
    Actual Behavior: Only after step 1 will the transactions go through a loading phase. Performing step 2 and selecting another employee will not
    cause the transactions to go through a loading phase. Instead the transactions on the page are just replaced all of a sudden without indication of any loading happening.
    
    I implemented a fix for this bug so to reproduce do it on the original application.

New Bug 2:
    Howto reproduce bug (be sure to refresh the page): 
    1. Select an employee from the dropdown before the transactions for all employees loading

    Expected Behavior: There could be many behaviors but a simple one is that a user
    shouldn't be able to select another employee while transactions are loading

    Actual behavior: Filter by employee has the name of the employee selected however the transactions
    are for all employees so the filter is misleading.

    I did not implement a fix for this as it may break test cases.
